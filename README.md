## Features in Detail

### **Token Quotas and Usage**
- Each user has a daily token quota defined in the `USER_QUOTAS` dictionary.
- Default quota (`DEFAULT_QUOTA`) applies to users not explicitly listed.
- Usage is tracked and stored persistently in `usage.json`.

### **Rate Limiting**
- Configurable rate limit (`RATE_LIMIT`) and time window (`TIME_WINDOW`).
- Prevents spam by enforcing a maximum number of requests per user within the defined window.

### **Custom Prompts and Modes**
- Users can set personalized prompts for contextual responses.
- Modes:
  - `o1`: Leverages `o1-preview` for comprehensive responses.
  - `mini`: Uses `o1-mini` for faster, lightweight interactions.

### **Role-Based Access**
- Only users with a specified role (`REQUIRED_ROLE_ID`) in the allowed guild (`ALLOWED_GUILD_ID`) can use the bot.

### **Response Handling**
- Long responses are split into multiple embeds to fit within Discord's character limits.
- Each embed includes token usage details in the footer.
